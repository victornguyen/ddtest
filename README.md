## Development Notes

- Thought I'd try out Middleman for this after our chat. It's pretty cool!
- Also gave DDBreakpoints a go.
- JS dependencies in Sprockets is a bit weird. Usually go with browserify/webpack, but wanted to do it the Middleman way for this.
- I like BEM, which can be a controversial opinion depending on the team.
- Thought I'd try out [Susy].
- In `_intro.erb`, the annoying little "for" text is in a script font that's not used anywhere else. We could inline a base64'ed subset of the font (with only the necessary chars), or we could talk to the designer (my preference).

I use Chrome Canary to get access to the latest dev tool hotness. Unless the day's build is broken, at which point I use regular Chrome.

I don't see any glaring accessibility issues with this layout/design. I'm probably missing something. The carousel I've used uses aria attributes to designate what is visible/hidden, which is nice. As I'm typing this I've just realised I forgot to add `alt` attributes to my images.

Compiled files can be generated with:

	bundle exec middleman build

They'll be dumped into the `build/` directory. Or you can view the `gh-pages` branch of this repo.
